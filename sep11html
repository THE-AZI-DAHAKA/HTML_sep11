            Death And Life
        </h1>
        
        <p>
           Far away and long ago, there was a great Japanese philosopher who said
           "People Die When They Are Killed."
           The profound knowledege hidden inside this statement can neither be
           understood or explained by mortal means.
           One has to ascend through the continuum of space and time just to explain
           the simple and direct meaning these very words may possess.
           To however completely comprehend this statement, one must transcend every 
           concept that exists inside the vast multiverse.
